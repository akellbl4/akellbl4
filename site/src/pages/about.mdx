# About Me

Hey, my name is Paul Mineev.

I share my expertise as a teacher at [LoftSchool](https://loftschool.ru) and provide mentoring sessions for people
who
want to grow fast. Sometimes I consult companies about tech-stack and review their projects. I write about
development, web specs, and about problems I faced and how to solve them.

I have been participating in conferences, meetups, webinars and so on as a speaker and spoken about development,
team
formation and project managment from dev perspective. Also, I'm always happy to be a mentor or a judge on
hackathons.
I already took part in more than 10 hacks such as McHacks, SF Hacks, and LA Hacks.
