From the very start to not so long ago my site was just several links to my social media and contacts. Since I started to write about development I decided to have my place where I can write what I want. So, I decided to use ~~Next.js~~ [Astro](https://astro.build) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the base for my website.
When I switched to Astro I moved [API implementation](https://github.com/akellbl4/pavel.mineev.me/tree/astro/worker) to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).
