			# {title}

			HeyðŸ‘‹! My name is Pavel Mineev and currently I'm working at [June Homes](https://junehomes.com) as a&nbsp;Principal Software Engineer in a&nbsp;full-stack team.

			I share my expertise as a teacher at [LoftSchool](https://loftschool.ru) and provide mentoring sessions for people who want to grow fast. Sometimes I consult companies about tech-stack and review their projects. I write about development, web specs, and about problems I faced and how to solve them.

			I have been participating in conferences, meetups, webinars and so on as a speaker and spoken about development, team formation and project managment from dev perspective. Also, I'm always happy to be a mentor or a judge on hackathons. I already took part in more than 10 hacks such as McHacks, SF Hacks, and LA Hacks.
