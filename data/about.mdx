title: About Me
---

Hey! My name is Pavel Mineev and currently I'm working at [June Homes](https://junehomes.com) as a&nbsp;leader of a&nbsp;full-stack team.

I share my expertise as a teacher at [LoftSchool](https://loftschool.ru) and provide mentoring sessions for people who want to grow fast. Sometimes I consult companies about tech-stack and review their projects. I write about development, web specs, and about problems I faced and how to solve them

I have been participating in conferences, meetups, webinars and so on as a speaker and spoken about development, team formation and project managment from dev perspective. Also, always happy to be a mentor or a judge on hackathons. I already took part in more then 10 hacks such as McHacks, SF Hacks, and LA Hacks.
